('**True.**\n\nThe trunk is a structural component that connects the roots to the branches. It forms a continuous structural support from the base of the tree to the branching points.', 'true')
('**False.**\n\nThe chain of logic is as follows:\n\n1. A dinner table is a structure with a tabletop and four legs.\n2. The tabletop is typically placed on top of the legs.\n3. The left back leg is one of the four legs of the dinner table.\n4. Therefore, the tabletop is not below the left back leg.', 'false')
('| Component | Relative Position |\n|---|---|\n| Tabletop | Above all legs |\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe tabletop is located above the legs of the table due to its position at the top of the table structure. The legs support the tabletop and are positioned under it.', 'true')
("**False.**\n\nThe chain of logic:\n\n* In an elm, 'leaves' are appendages of 'branches'.\n* Branches are connected to the trunk.\n* Therefore, 'leaves' are indirectly connected to the trunk through 'branches'.", 'true')
('**True.**\n\nThe hierarchical structure of an oak tree is:\n\n- **Roots** are below the ground and support the entire tree.\n- **Trunk** is the main stem that rises above ground.\n- **Branches** extend from the trunk.\n- **Leaves** are attached to the branches.\n\nTherefore, the roots are located below the trunk in an oak tree.', 'true')

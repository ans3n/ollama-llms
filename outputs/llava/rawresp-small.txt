('True. The trunk of a tree is the main stem that supports all the branches and leaves. It is from which the branches grow, so it can be said that the trunk is connected to the branches.', 'true.')
('False.\n\nThe tabletop is the surface of the table, which is usually the top part of the table. The legs of the table support the tabletop and hold it up off the ground. Therefore, the tabletop is not located below any of the legs. Instead, the legs are attached to the underside of the tabletop, allowing them to support the weight of the tabletop and any objects placed on top of it.', 'false.')
('False.\n\nThe components of a simple table are arranged in the following manner: the left front leg and the right front leg form the base, and the left back leg and the right back leg extend from the base to provide support. The tabletop is then placed on top of the legs. Therefore, the tabletop is not located below either the left front leg or the left back leg; it is situated above them.', 'false.')
('False.\n\nLeaves are connected to branches as they grow directly out of the branches and form the canopy of the tree. Leaves receive nutrients from the branches through the vascular system and depend on them for support and water transport.', 'true.')
('True. In an oak tree, the roots are located below the trunk. The roots grow underground, drawing water and nutrients from the soil to help support and nourish the tree. The trunk serves as a central supporting structure for the branches and leaves above it.', 'true.')

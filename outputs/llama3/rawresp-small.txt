('**FALSE**\n\nMy chain of logic:\n\n* A dinner table has a flat surface, which is the tabletop.\n* The legs of the table are typically attached to the bottom or underside of the tabletop.\n* Therefore, the tabletop cannot be "below" any of the legs, including the left back leg.', 'false')
('TRUE.\n\nMy chain of logic is as follows:\n\n* A tabletop is the flat surface on top of a table.\n* The legs of a table are the vertical supports that hold the tabletop in place.\n* In a standard rectangular table, the left front leg and the tabletop do not overlap or intersect with each other.\n* Therefore, if we were to draw an imaginary line representing the height of the tabletop, it would be below the level of the left front leg.\n\nSo, in terms of relative positions, the tabletop is indeed below the left front leg.', 'true')

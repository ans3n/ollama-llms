('True. In a tree, the trunk is the main vertical structure that supports the branches, so it is physically connected to the branches. The branches grow out of the trunk and rely on it for strength and stability.', 'true')
('False. \n\nIn a typical dinner table setup, the tabletop is situated above all the legs of the table. The tabletop is the surface on which items are placed during a meal, and the legs are what support and hold up the tabletop. Therefore, the tabletop is not below any of the legs, including the left back leg.', 'false.')
('False. The tabletop is typically positioned above all of the legs in a standard table structure. Since the tabletop is the surface that rests on top of the legs, it is actually positioned above the left front leg in this scenario.', 'false')
('False. In an elm tree, leaves are connected to branches. The branches hold the leaves and provide support for them to grow and receive sunlight for photosynthesis. Therefore, leaves are directly connected to branches in an elm tree.', 'false.')
('True. \nIn an oak tree, the roots are located below the trunk. This is because the roots of a tree are usually underground, spreading out to anchor the tree and absorb water and nutrients from the soil. The trunk, on the other hand, is the main vertical support of the tree above ground. So, in the hierarchy of components in an oak tree, roots are located below the trunk.', 'true')

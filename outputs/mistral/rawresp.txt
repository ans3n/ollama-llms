('True. In a typical setup, the left and right front legs of a dining table are two separate pieces and are not connected to each other. The connection between the tabletop and each of the four legs is what supports the structure, and this is typically done independently for each leg.', 'true')
('True. In a biped (a two-legged creature or object), the left leg is typically connected to the torso. This connection is usually made through the hip joint, which allows for movement and flexibility.', 'true. the left leg is connected to the torso in a biped.')
('True. In a typical design of a nightstand (or any furniture with four legs), the left back leg and the left front leg are two separate pieces and do not have a direct connection. They are typically connected only through the tabletop and the joints where each leg meets it.', 'true. the left back leg is not directly connected to the left front leg in a typical nightstand design.')
("False. In a typical design of a four-legged object like a nightstand, the front legs (both right and left) are not directly connected to the back legs. Each pair of legs forms a separate support structure, with the tabletop resting on top of them. The tabletop is typically supported by the intersection of the left and right front legs and the left and right back legs. However, in some designs or modifications, this could be different; it's essential to refer to specific details for accurate information.", 'false.')
('False. In a humanoid as described, the left ear is not positioned below the torso. The ears (both left and right) are located on either side of the head, which sits atop the torso. Therefore, the left ear is above or level with the torso, but never below it.', 'true. the left ear is not below the torso in a humanoid as described.')
('True. In general, a typical bench design has the seat (or cushion) supported by its own four legs, which are usually the front and back legs on each side of the bench. The left back leg does not directly support the seat; it is part of the structural framework that holds up the backrest. However, there could be exceptions to this design depending on the specific construction of the bench in question.', 'true.')
('False. In a typical design of a bench, the seat is usually flat and horizontal, while the legs are vertical and positioned underneath the seat.

('True. The trunk of an elm tree is directly connected to the roots and branches emerge from the trunk. However, it is important to note that technically speaking, the branches are a part of the trunk as they grow out of it. So while the trunk is not directly connected to each individual branch, they are still considered part of the same system. This is often true for most trees. The distinction between trunk and branches can be somewhat nuanced, but generally, one can say that the trunk is not directly connected to branches as branches grow out from the trunk.', 'true, the trunk of an elm tree is not directly connected to individual branches. however, branches are part of the trunk system.')
('True. The trunk is indeed connected to the roots. The trunk emerges from the roots and serves as the main stem of the tree, providing support for branches and eventually leaves.', 'true.')
('True. The trunk of a maple tree is indeed connected to the roots. The roots grow underground and anchor the tree in place while absorbing water and nutrients for growth. The trunk serves as a conduit, transporting these resources from the roots upwards to the branches and leaves.', 'true. the trunk of a maple tree is connected to its roots.')
('True. In most common chairs, the seat and backrest are typically connected, forming the main structure of the chair. This connection can be through a single piece (like in a kitchen chair), or multiple pieces (as in a dining chair with a separate back and seat). The seat and backrest, while distinct components, are designed to work together as part of the same functional object.', 'true.')

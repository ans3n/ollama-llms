('True.\n\nThe logic is simple. The tabletop is placed on the left front leg, left back leg, right front leg, and right back leg. Therefore, the tabletop is below the left back leg.', 'true. the tabletop is below the left back leg.')

("True.\n\nThe premise of the question is that the 'leaves' object is not connected to the 'branches' object. The chain of logic implies that if the 'leaves' object were connected to the 'branches' object, then 'leaves' would be a child of 'branches'.

("True.\n\nThe chain of logic is as follows:\n\n* **Roots** are a part of the **trunk**.\n* The **trunk** is a part of the **branches**.\n* The **branches** are a part of the **leaves**.\n\nTherefore, 'roots' is below 'trunk' in an oak.", 'true. the answer is correct.')

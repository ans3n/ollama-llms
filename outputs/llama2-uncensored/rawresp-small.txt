('True - The order of the words in a list is not necessarily their physical location in space. For example, if you have a table with four legs, it does not follow that the left front leg is physically to the left or below anything else on the tabletop. Similarly, the right back leg could be located somewhere near the center of the tabletop, and still technically be considered "below" all other components in terms of physical order.', 'true')

('False. In an elm tree, the branches are not directly below the trunk. The roots of an elm tree grow underground and extend outward from the base of the tree, while the trunk is above ground and extends upwards from the roots. The branches emerge from the sides of the trunk at various heights and angles, depending on the shape of the tree and its growing conditions. Therefore, branches are not directly below trunk in an elm tree.', 'false.')
('Yes, the answer to this question is "true." To explain why it is true, we can use logical reasoning. \nFirstly, a table has two legs on each side (left and right), making it have four legs in total. Secondly, the left back leg of a table is always located at the very end of the left-hand side of the table, meaning that it is never closer to the right than to the left. \nThus, we can conclude that if there are two legs on either side (left and right), then \'left back leg\' will be farther from \'right back leg\' compared to any other pair of legs (either in the same or opposite direction). Therefore, it is always true that \'left back leg\' is left of \'right back leg.\'', 'true')
("No, 'bow' is not behind 'cabin'. \n\nTrue.\n\nHere's why it's true:\n- A sailboat has a bow and a stern.\n- The bow is the front of the boat, while the stern is the back.\n- The cabin is located on the deck of the boat, usually near the bow or the stern.\n- Therefore, 'bow' cannot be behind 'cabin'.", 'true or false?')

("True. \nLogic: A table has legs and a top, in that order from bottom to top. Therefore, the tabletop must be above all of the legs (including left front leg). Since 'left back leg' is one of those legs, it follows that 'tabletop' is above it as well.", 'true')
("True - In a table, the position of each component can be determined based on their relationship to each other. The left front leg will always appear to the left of any other component in the table due to its location at the end of the left side leg. Therefore, 'tabletop' is located below 'left front leg'.", "true - in a table, the position of each component can be determined based on their relationship to each other. the left front leg will always appear to the left of any other component in the table due to its location at the end of the left side leg. therefore, 'tabletop' is located below 'left front leg'.")

("False. The order of the components in an oak tree cannot be determined based on their relative positions underneath each other. While it is true that the roots are usually located at or near the base of the trunk, this does not mean that all trees follow a specific pattern of arrangement. Furthermore, branches and leaves may also grow from different parts of the trunk depending on environmental factors such as light availability and nutrient levels in the soil. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether 'roots' are always below 'trunk' based on this information alone.", 'false.')

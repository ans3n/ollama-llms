('True. The trunk connects the roots to the branches. This connection allows sap and water to flow up from the roots to the leaves through the vascular system in the tree. Without this connection, a tree would not be able to transport resources throughout its structure, resulting in an unhealthy or dead tree.', 'true.')
('Answer: True', 'answer: true')
('Yes, the tabletop is always lower than the left front leg because it sits on top of that leg.', 'true.')
('False. The leaves are connected to the branches via the vascular system of the tree, which consists of xylem and phloem tissues that transport water and nutrients throughout the plant.', 'false')
('True - The answer is "true". \nThe chain of logic is as follows:\n1) Roots are part of a tree.\n2) A tree has a trunk.\n3) Trunks are located above roots in the tree.\n4) Therefore, roots are below trunks in the tree.', 'the answer is "false".')

If the chassis were to be placed on top of any individual wheel, it would cause imbalance in weight distribution, resulting in an unsafe situation for the passengers and driver. Therefore, 'chassis' cannot be placed above any of the wheels, making it true that it is not located directly above 'right front wheel'.", 'true.')
('False. \nIf you look at the definition of "chair" and break it down into its components, you can see that a chair has four legs (two front legs, two back legs) and a seat. The backrest is not considered to be a leg in this context, but rather a part of the chair\'s support structure. Therefore, the chain of logic goes as follows:\n- Right back leg = a leg on the chair that supports its weight (in this case, it supports the chair\'s weight from behind)\n- Right front leg = another leg on the chair that also supports its weight (from the front)\n- Right back leg cannot be "behind" right front leg since they are in different positions on the chair.\nSo, right back leg is not behind right front leg.', 'false')

('True - Roots are the underground part of a maple tree and are located directly below the trunk. Branches, on the other hand, are above ground and are connected to the trunk by a main stem called the leader or bole. Therefore, roots lie directly below the trunk in the soil while branches lie above the trunk at various heights along the main stem.', 'true')
("True - the logic is as follows: \n- The elm tree has roots at its base that anchor it to the ground. \n- From the roots, a trunk grows upwards and becomes larger in girth than the branches. \n- The trunk then divides into many smaller branches which grow outward from the tree's main stem. \nTherefore, the branches are below the roots because they originate from the trunk which is located underground beneath the tree's foundation.", 'true - the branches of an elm tree are below its roots.')
("True. \n\nExplanation: The chair has an order to its structure where the different components are placed in a specific manner. One such arrangement is that of the legs and seat, which are arranged in a particular sequence starting from left to right. Similarly, there exists an arrangement for the backrest as well. Therefore, 'backrest' must be below 'seat', since it follows a similar pattern in its placement within the chair.", 'true.')

("True. In a truck, the order of components from front to rear (including wheels) goes as follows: left mirror, right mirror, driver seat, left headlight, right headlight, left front wheel, center console, left back wheel, trunk, right rear wheel, right front wheel, and so on. Therefore, since 'left back wheel' is not in the center position, it must be behind 'left front wheel', which means that 'left back wheel' is ahead of 'left front wheel'.", 'true')
('The answer to the question is "true". \nLogic behind this statement: \n- The word "above" indicates hierarchy or ranking.\n- In a tree structure, the roots are at the lowest level and branches are on top of it.\n- Therefore, by definition, branches can be said to be above roots in terms of their positioning within the tree structure.', 'the answer is "true".')
('True. The logic is that a chair is composed of various components that are connected together in specific ways to create the final product. In this case, it is clear that the seat is connected to the backrest through the back legs, which in turn are connected to each other via the front legs.

('True, because the rudder is located behind the mast on most sailboats.', 'true.')
("Yes, the 'trunk' of a tree is connected to its roots through the process of photosynthesis. As the plant grows and matures, it takes in carbon dioxide from the air through its leaves, which are located at the top of the trunk. The carbon dioxide is converted into sugars that fuel the growth of the plant. These sugars then travel down the branches and trunk to the roots where they are stored for energy. Thus, the 'trunk' can be considered connected to its roots through this process of photosynthesis and sugar transportation.", 'true.')
("True - A ship has parts that can be arranged in various configurations depending on the specific layout. However, in general, a cabin will likely be located to one side of the port side and starboard sides, making it right of them.

("True. \nLogic: The chair has five legs in total, which are placed in a specific order from front to back. Therefore, the left front leg and left back leg form an L-shape, with the right front leg being in the middle of that shape.

('True. In a biped, the left leg is indeed connected to the torso. This is because the torso is the central part of the body that connects all other parts together.

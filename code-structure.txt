1. Generate questions and prompt the LLM with the questions.
For each question, note down the type of object and all components for each question in a file(objects.txt)

2. Receive only the reasoning in a file(reasoning.txt)

3. Python program generates the object specific Prolog rules from objects.txt

4. Python program generates illogical queries(such as illogical cycle loops) to test within the Prolog script

5. Python program integrates the new object specific rules with the rest of the Prolog rules

6. Prolog program tests with the illogical test queries OR have the LLM manually scan the Prolog program for illogical
rules(ex. right(A, B) and left(A, B) both exist)

7. If any of the test queries return an incorrect result, throw an error to Python script. If all successful, return an
output of either true or false to the Python script

8. If an output is received by the Python script, return that output
